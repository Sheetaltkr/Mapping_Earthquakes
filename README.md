# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

- Build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world.
- Support website and mobile application development by using the latest earthquake GEOJSON data from the U.S Geological survey website.
- Traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript and D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on Map box map through an API request.
    - Show the magnitude and location of each earthquake in a popup marker.
    - Make the diameter for each earthquake reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color and with legend providing context of your map data.
    - Add fault lines on the map to illustrate the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.
